Make brief statement on why prediction is a general principle of intelligence

Define PGI 

The observation that every individual neuron individually minimizes energetic difference while also joining a larger neuronal network leads \us to develop a network of world models. This is an extension to parallel combinations such as neural ensembles and mixtures of experts \cite{Shazeer2017} like Switch Transformers as well as serial combinations like content filtration networks and hierarchiel prediction and reinforcement learning. \We combine Hinton's GLOM \cite{hinton2021represent} with a high-dimensional derivative or Kohonen's self-organizing map \cite{58325} to produce a neural network architecture \we term self-agglomerating maps.
